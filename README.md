Trying out pygame to make a fully functional 2D game. Took a few days of just trying things out. 

Includes all sprites I used and edited. 

Code is super messy in that all the game mechanics and everything else is all in main.py.

Started with a box I could move on the screen and turned into it's own beast (PG13). Future game's will be much more structured and organized and... PG?
