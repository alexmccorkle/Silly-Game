#### _(because I'm immature)_

Trying out Pygame without having used any tutorials or anything before, just to mess around and see where I end up.  


Features:
- All-time High-Score displayed at the end of the round
- Start Menu
- Restart Button
- 2D (Left/Right/Jump) Movement and Effect (Damaged/Healing) Sprites
- Game Music and Sound Effects
  - Hit effects for damage and healing 
- Levels
  - Speed and number of falling objects increase as the game goes on




#### Note:
This is not the most organized game structure. All of the code is written on main.py. Future projects will be much organized as this can make future development/expansion of the project much easier. 

Folder contains all sprites and images used so should be able to run it from within the folder by using
$python3 main.py
